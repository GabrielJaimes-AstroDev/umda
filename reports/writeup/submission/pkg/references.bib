	abstract = {With an ever-increasing usage of electronic structure programs by the microwave spectroscopy community, there is a growing need to assess the performance of commonly used, low-cost quantum chemical methods, particularly with respect to rotational constants because these quantities are central in guiding experiments. Here, we systematically benchmark the predictive power afforded by several low-level ab initio and density functionals combined with a variety of basis sets that are commonly employed in the rotational spectroscopy literature. The data set in our analysis consists of 6916 optimized geometries of 76 representative species where high-resolution experimental gas-phase rotational constants are available. We adopted a Bayesian approach for analyzing the performance of each method and basis set combination, employing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling to determine the uncertainty in theoretical predictions of rotational constants and dipole moments. Our analysis establishes a hierarchy of accuracy and uncertainty, with commonly used methods in the rotational spectroscopy literature such as B3LYP and MP2 yielding lower accuracy and higher uncertainty than newer-generation functionals such as those from the Minnesota family, and ωB97X-D, which, when paired with a modestly sized 6-31+G(d) basis, provides optimal performance with respect to computational cost. Additionally, we provide statistical scaling factors that can be used to empirically correct for vibration–rotation effects, as a means to further improve the accuracy of rotational constants predicted from these relatively low-cost theoretical methods. As part of this, we demonstrate that the uncertainties can be used in simulations of rotational spectra to cross-correlate with broadband spectra, a methodology that could be used to quickly and efficiently survey experimental spectra for new molecules.},

Here we introduce a new translation-rotation-internal coordinate (TRIC) system which explicitly includes the collective translations and rotations of molecules, or parts of molecules such as monomers or ligands, as degrees of freedom. The translations are described as the centroid position and the orientations are represented with the exponential map parameterization of quaternions. When TRIC is incorporated into geometry optimization calculations, the performance is consistently superior to existing coordinate systems for a diverse set of systems including water clusters, organic semiconductor donor-acceptor complexes, and small proteins, all of which are characterized by nontrivial intermolecular interactions. The method also introduces a new way to scan the molecular orientations while allowing orthogonal degrees of freedom to relax. Our findings indicate that an explicit description of molecular translation and rotation is a natural way to traverse the many-dimensional potential energy surface.},

Like the Word2vec models, where vectors of closely related words are in close proximity in the vector space, Mol2vec learns vector representations of molecular substructures that point in similar directions for chemically related substructures. Compounds can ﬁnally be encoded as vectors by summing the vectors of the individual substructures and, for instance, be fed into supervised machine learning approaches to predict compound properties. The underlying substructure vector embeddings are obtained by training an unsupervised machine learning approach on a so-called corpus of compounds that consists of all available chemical matter. The resulting Mol2vec model is pretrained once, yields dense vector representations, and overcomes drawbacks of common compound feature representations such as sparseness and bit collisions. The prediction capabilities are demonstrated on several compound property and bioactivity data sets and compared with results obtained for Morgan ﬁngerprints as a reference compound representation. Mol2vec can be easily combined with ProtVec, which employs the same Word2vec concept on protein sequences, resulting in a proteochemometric approach that is alignment-independent and thus can also be easily used for proteins with low sequence similarities.},

	abstract = {Background
There are two line notations of chemical structures that have established themselves in the field: the SMILES string and the InChI string. The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string.

Results
I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79\% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77\% of the PubChem subset.

Conclusions
The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain – such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES – the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.},

Also, as a repository, PubChem constantly optimizes and develops its deposition system answering many demands of both high- and low-volume depositors. The PubChem information platform allows users to search, review and download bioassay description and data. The PubChem platform also enables researchers to collect, compare and analyze biological test results through web-based and programmatic tools. In this work, we provide an update for the PubChem BioAssay resource, including information content growth, data model extension and new developments of data submission, retrieval, analysis and download tools.},

Large dimensionality of the initial data space may require significant computational resources and slow down the GTM construction. Therefore, it may be meaningful to reduce the number of descriptors used for encoding molecular structures. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a standard preprocessing tool, suffers from the information loss upon the dimensionality reduction. As an alternative, we propose to use substructure vector embedding provided by the mol2vec technique. In addition to the data dimensionality reduction, this technology also accounts for proximity of substructures in molecular graphs. In this study, dimensionality of large descriptor spaces of ISIDA fragment descriptors or Morgan fingerprints were reduced using either the PCA or the mol2vec method. The latter significantly speeds up GTM training without compromising its predictive power in bioactivity classification tasks.},

A molecular structure can be explicitly represented as either a connection table (CT) or linear notation, such as SMILES, which is a language describing the connectivity of atoms in the molecular structure. Conventional SAR/SPR approaches rely on partitioning the CT into a set of predefined substructures as structural descriptors. In this work, we propose a new method to identifying SAR/SPR through linear notation (for example, SMILES) syntax analysis with self-attention mechanism, an interpretable deep learning architecture. The method has been evaluated by predicting chemical properties, toxicology, and bioactivity from experimental data sets. Our results demonstrate that the method yields superior performance compared with state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the method can produce chemically interpretable results, which can be used for a chemist to design and synthesize the activity- or property-improved compounds.},

One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

For both detections, we performed velocity stacking and matched ﬁlter analyses using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, and for trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene, three rotational lines were observed at low signal-to-noise (∼3σ). From this analysis, we derive column densities of 2 × 1011 and 3 × 1011 cm−2 for vinylcyanoacetylene and trans-(E)-cyanovinylacetylene, respectively, and an upper limit of {\textless}2 × 1011 cm−2 for trans-(Z)cyanovinylacetylene. Comparisons with G3//B3LYP semiempirical thermochemical calculations indicate abundances of the [H3C5N] isomers are not consistent with their thermodynamic stability, and instead their abundances are mainly driven by dynamics. We provide a discussion on how these species may be formed in TMC-1, with reference to related molecules like vinyl cyanide (CH2 = CHC ≡ N). As part of this discussion, we performed the same analysis for ethyl cyanide (CH3CH2C ≡ N), the hydrogenation product of CH2 = CHC ≡ N. This analysis provides evidence—at 4.2σ signiﬁcance—of an upper limit to the column density of {\textless}4 × 1011 cm−2; an order of magnitude lower than previous upper limits toward this source.},

	abstract = {As machine learning (ML) has matured, it has opened a new frontier in theoretical and computational chemistry by offering the promise of simultaneous paradigm shifts in accuracy and efficiency. Nowhere is this advance more needed, but also more challenging to achieve, than in the discovery of open-shell transition metal complexes. Here, localized d or f electrons exhibit variable bonding that is challenging to capture even with the most computationally demanding methods. Thus, despite great promise, clear obstacles remain in constructing ML models that can supplement or even replace explicit electronic structure calculations. In this article, I outline the recent advances in building ML models in transition metal chemistry, including the ability to approach sub-kcal/mol accuracy on a range of properties with tailored representations, to discover and enumerate complexes in large chemical spaces, and to reveal opportunities for design through analysis of feature importance. I discuss unique considerations that have been essential to enabling ML in open-shell transition metal chemistry, including (a) the relationship of data set size/diversity, model complexity, and representation choice, (b) the importance of quantitative assessments of both theory and model domain of applicability, and (c) the need to enable autonomous generation of reliable, large data sets both for ML model training and in active learning or discovery contexts. Finally, I summarize the next steps toward making ML a mainstream tool in the accelerated discovery of transition metal complexes.

	abstract = {The technological advances of the past century, marked by the computer revolution and the advent of high-throughput screening technologies in drug discovery, opened the path to the computational analysis and visualization of bioactive molecules. For this purpose, it became necessary to represent molecules in a syntax that would be readable by computers and understandable by scientists of various fields. A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. We present here some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in drug discovery, many of which are based on graph representations. Furthermore, we describe applications of these representations in AI-driven drug discovery. Our aim is to provide a brief guide on structural representations that are essential to the practice of AI in drug discovery. This review serves as a guide for researchers who have little experience with the handling of chemical representations and plan to work on applications at the interface of these fields.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner.},

	abstract = {We present an extended version of the two-phase gas–grain code nautilus to the three-phase modelling of gas and grain chemistry of cold cores. In this model, both the mantle and the surface are considered as chemically active. We also take into account the competition among reaction, diffusion and evaporation. The model predictions are confronted to ice observations in the envelope of low-mass and massive young stellar objects as well as towards background stars. Modelled gas-phase abundances are compared to species observed towards TMC-1 (CP) and L134N dark clouds. We find that our model successfully reproduces the observed ice species. It is found that the reaction–diffusion competition strongly enhances reactions with barriers and more specifically reactions with H2, which is abundant on grains. This finding highlights the importance having a good approach to determine the abundance of H2 on grains. Consequently, it is found that the major N-bearing species on grains go from NH3 to N2 and HCN when the reaction–diffusion competition is taken into account. In the gas phase and before a few 105 yr, we find that the three-phase model does not have a strong impact on the observed species compared to the two-phase model. After this time, the computed abundances dramatically decrease due to the strong accretion on dust, which is not counterbalanced by the desorption less efficient than in the two-phase model. This strongly constrains the chemical age of cold cores to be of the order of few 105 yr.},

The present state of knowledge concerning the rate coefficients and their uncertainties for the major gas-phase processes—ion-neutral reactions, neutral-neutral reactions, radiative association, and dissociative recombination—is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on those key reactions that have been identified, by sensitivity analyses, as ‘crucial’ in determining the predicted abundances of the species observed in the interstellar medium. These sensitivity analyses have been carried out for gas-phase models of three representative, molecule-rich, astronomical sources: the cold dense molecular clouds TMC-1 and L134N, and the expanding circumstellar envelope IRC +10216. Our review has led to the proposal of new values and uncertainties for the rate coefficients of many of the key reactions. The impact of these new data on the predicted abundances in TMC-1 and L134N is reported. Interstellar dust particles also influence the observed abundances of molecules in the interstellar medium. Their role is included in gas-grain, as distinct from gas-phase only, models. We review the methods for incorporating both accretion onto, and reactions on, the surfaces of grains in such models, as well as describing some recent experimental efforts to simulate and examine relevant processes in the laboratory. These efforts include experiments on the surface-catalyzed recombination of hydrogen atoms, on chemical processing on and in the ices that are known to exist on the surface of interstellar grains, and on desorption processes, which may enable species formed on grains to return to the gas-phase.},
